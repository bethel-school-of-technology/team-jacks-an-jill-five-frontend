              <p>
                Born and raised In Indianapolis, Indiana I‚Äôve always had a knack
                for creativity through graphic design and problem-solving. My
                inquisitive nature has always wanted to know the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù things
                work the way they do. I enjoy learning, reading, playing video
                games, and spending time with family.

                I was born and raised in Eastern NC, lived in Hawaii and Florida
                for a while, but eventually returned to my NC roots. I've always
                been a bit of a computer nerd and dabbled in programming and Web
                design. I love problem solving and creating efficient solutions
                and designs. When I'm not coding, I enjoy time with my family,
                woodworking, restoring old furniture, and visiting fairs and
                festivals!

                Hi there! I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for
                problem-solving and bringing innovative solutions to the table.
                Growing up, I knew I was destined to be an engineer and even
                built my first computer at a young age. My journey has taken me
                from electrical engineering to software engineering, where I've
                honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development. In
                my free time, I enjoy indulging my creative side as a musician,
                playing the drums since I was five. I also like to stay active
                and play basketball regularly. Additionally, I have a keen
                interest in day trading and coding on the side, always looking
                for new opportunities to learn and grow.

              <p>
                Hello! I live in southwest Ohio with my wife and three young kids.
                I found out about Bethel College through Anthony ONeal and Dave
                Ramsey, and I started dreaming about what a career in Tech
                would mean for my family! I am excited about my journey as a
                software engineer, and I'm grateful for everyone who has helped
                get to this point! In my spare time I love being with my wife
                and kids, teaching my kids how to make great coffee (they don't
                drink any!), and running.
                <br></br>Ps- I'm only at the Fair for the food!

              <h3>Hi üëã</h3>
              <p>
                I am an Ohio State Buckeye, raised in Columbus, Ohio. I have
                also lived in New York, Virginia, and Florida. I started coding
                as a kid on an Atari computer in the early 80's, creating a
                baseball statistics compiler, animated graphics, games and music
                with the old BASIC program. Then I took a break from coding for
                40 years, seeking ventures in writing, filmmaking, and teaching.
                Yet I always felt the calling to get back to using my creativity
                and problem solving in the tech industry, so here I am. Enjoy
                our WHAT's FAIR app, and I'll see you on the Ferris Wheel.
